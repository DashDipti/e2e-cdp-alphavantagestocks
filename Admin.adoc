=== 2. CDF Flow failing
*Issue*: The CDF Nifi flow fails at the last step. +
*Solution*: There is a permission that needs to be added in AWS whose screenshot is added below. The additional permission is shown in the screenshot - `meta-workshop-stock-custom`. +

The .json file is uploaded in the admin folder.

*Issue*: The CDE job was failing. +

=== 4. Impala table is not visible (Hue/Data Viz)
*Issue*: The Impala tables are not visible in Hue and in Data Viz when the user logs in with their usernames like `wuser00`. +
*Solution*: Ranger permission needs to be appropriately set for `workshop-users` which is a group for users participating in the workshop. These users are part of the `workshop-users`. +
